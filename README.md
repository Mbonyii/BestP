1. What is Logging?
Logging is the practice of recording events, actions, and information during the execution of a software application. It involves creating a detailed record (log) of what's happening within a system, including errors, warnings, and other significant occurrences.

2. Why Logging is Important
Logging is crucial for several reasons:

Debugging and Error Analysis: Logs provide insights into what went wrong when an error occurs.
Monitoring and Maintenance: Logs help in monitoring the health and performance of an application.
Security and Auditing: Logs can track access and modifications, aiding in security audits.
Understanding Application Behavior: Logs provide a historical record of application activity, useful for understanding usage patterns and diagnosing issues.




3. Understanding Logging Levels
Logging levels categorize the importance and severity of log messages. Common logging levels are:

TRACE: Fine-grained informational events useful for debugging.
DEBUG: Informational events useful for debugging.
INFO: General informational messages that highlight the progress of the application.
WARN: Potentially harmful situations that might lead to problems.
ERROR: Error events that might still allow the application to continue running.
FATAL: Severe error events that lead to premature termination of the application.
